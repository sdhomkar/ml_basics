# Hands-on Machine Learning 
Notebook pertaining to basics of ML

The notebook allows the user to perform the following tasks:
1. Generate dummy training data
2. Split the data into training and testing tests
3. Construct various artificial deep neural network architectures - specifically - Dense, Long-short term memory, and convolutional neural network
4. Training the networks and testing the results

## Use of Google Colab platform
The code has ideally been designed to work in Colab. Specifically, the use of GPUs can significantly reduce the training times.

## Training data
The training and test data have been stored in .npz format. Arrays containing training data have been split into 2 portions to mitigate the file size constraints.

## Training histories and trained networks
The training histories have been stored as .csv files and entire pre-trained networks have also been saved.
